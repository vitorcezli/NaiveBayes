# NaiveBayes

A NaiveBayes implementation for text classification, based on Machine Learning, Tom Mitchell. Use 'make' for compilation. The commands are:



java NaiveBayes -t \[training file\] \[object\]: outputs an object that will be used later for classification.

java NaiveBayes -c \[object\] \[file that will be classified\] \[result file\]: outputs a file with the classification results.



The commands 'make object' and 'make classify' were created to show how to use this class.
